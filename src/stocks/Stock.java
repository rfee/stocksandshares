 * Notes
 * 1. We use an interface rather than extending a base class here because we are
 *    not familiar with the nature of stock.
 * 2. We probably should a symbol type class rather than String if symbol names
 *    have some rules e.g. 3 letter names only.
 * 3. All money is represented as longs rather than floating point because
 *    floating point are approximations to actual numbers and are never exact.
